Hey! I'm vesper and I currently have experience in both Python and Rust. I am working on skills in Rust and C++ and looking for open-source projects to contribute to.
I am far from an expert so please audit my code because there will probably be some dumb mistake in it.

You can contact me at this email here: ves-dev.jumbo485@passmail.com
This is an email alias so it looks weird, don't worry about it.
